This is just a simple terminal program that uses ncurses to draw characters in the terminal.
It compiles for linux only as elf64-x86-64.
Currently only processes user input and can display some debug information on the screen.
Made a simple(bad) version of Snake. There's a "Test Bed" which is just a routine where you simply write characters in the terminal to test things (I use to implement simple drawing routines i.e lines, basic shapes, filling algorithms, etc)
